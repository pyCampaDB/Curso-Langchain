       " \"\\nTurning to slide 6 and the financial year 2023 overview. I'm pleased to be able to present\\nanother solid year for the group, despite challenging market conditions. FFO was lower but\\nabove initial guidance provided at the financial year 2022 results, of AUD 0.25 to AUD 0.26 per\\nsecurity. Distributions declared for the period were up 2.9%. This was a great outcome given the\\nhigher interest rates experienced throughout the financial year 2023.\",\n",
       " \"\\nAs a result of higher interest rates and consequential impact on capitalization and discount\\nrates, the group's property portfolio value decreased by 6.5% on a like-for-like basis over 12\\nmonths.

       " '\\nTurning to slide 8 and some key themes within office markets. Tenants are accommodating for\\nquick feasible (00:06:18) occupancy. And whilst this is still below pre-pandemic levels, more\\nemployers are mandating minimum days in the office. Vacancy rates have moved higher with',\n",
       " \"\\nGrowth's (00:06:32) vacancy rate is 10% and has remained consistently lower versus the\\nmarkets in which it operates. We have demonstrated an ongoing ability to lease significant\\namounts of the portfolio each year, reducing expiring lease (00:06:49).\",\n",
       " '\\nTurning to the industrial property sector on slide 9. The positive momentum in the industrial\\nmarkets continued in financial year 2023 due to a shortage of modern warehouse space across\\nall markets, underpinned by growth in e-commerce and demand for supply chain infrastructure.',\n",
       " \"\\nVacancy continued to fall in the group's markets as demand outstripped limited supply with the\\nnational vacancy rate reaching a record low of 0.6% in June 2023. Rent growth continued over\\nthe year, with most markets recording double-digit growth in rents.\",\n",
       " '\\nMoving to slide 10 and funds management. A long-term growth platform for the group is the\\nacquisition of Fortius Funds Management, which was completed in September 2022. Fortius is\\na property fund manager with a 30-year plus track record of delivering strong returns to its\\ninvestors. During the period we successfully integrated Fortius and we are now operating as\\none business. Despite challenging transaction market conditions which impacted our ability to\\ngrow FUM, we have been active but diligent. There remains good appetite from investors for the\\nrisk-adjusted investment returns. You can also see on the slide 2 of the funds divested assets,\\nproviding excellent returns for investors. And this was the main driver of the declining funds\\nsince acquisition.

Whilst interest rates may still increase, it's fair\\nto say that they are unlikely to appreciate what they (00:09:11) have in the past year. The\\nfutures market at this time is indicating the cash rate is closer to the peak. Inflation, while still\\nhigh, is abating, and unemployment remains resilient in spite of higher interest rates.

       " '\\nThe Growthpoint AUD 4.8 billion balance sheet portfolio consists of the modern office and\\nindustrial assets, which are principally leased to government listed and large private tenants and\\nprovide the bedrock of a resilient cash flow for our securityholders.',\n",
       " \"\\nOn slide 14, we highlight the key office and industrial portfolio metrics. Increased interest rates\\nhave negatively impacted on the group's valuations over the year, with cap rate expansion\\nbeing exhibited across the portfolio. The group's office portfolio is reduced by 9.4% on a like-forlike basis over the year. Growthpoint's industrial portfolio valuations only have witnessed a slight\\ndecline, with the 70 basis points of yield expansion being largely offset by strong market rental\\ngrowth.\",\n",
       " '\\nOffice occupancy is lower and the year-to-year decline is primarily attributable to the vacancy of\\n(00:11:24) 5 Murray Rose Avenue in Sydney Olympic Park, accounting for 3% of the office\\nportfolio income. The leasing campaign is progressing with the 6 stars NABERS rated building\\nand positively viewed by prospective tenants. It is important to remember that we have received\\na surrender payment from the tenant, which is reflected in the accounts this year as the lease\\nwas due to expire in April 2024.',\n",
       " '\\nDion will expand on this later. The WALE has remained stable across the portfolio at 6 years.',\n",
       " '\\nThe office portfolio WALE, 6.3 years continues to underpin the resilience of the portfolio. On\\nslide 15, our portfolio is exemplified by secure tenants with long leases with positive industry\\nfundamentals. 40% of our office portfolio income is derived from government tenants. Our high\\nquality, energy efficient buildings are attractive for government tenants, and importantly, in this\\nperiod of uncertainty, the WALE of our government office tenants is 10.3 years. Tenant\\nengagement is a major focus for Growthpoint, and this has been reflected by achieving industry\\nleading tenant satisfaction results in the independent annual tenant survey.',\n",
       " '\\nMoving to slide 16, and the leasing activity during the year. Across the office portfolio, the group\\nexecuted 33 leases, accounting for approximately 32,000 square meters of space, representing\\n9.2% of the office portfolio income. The group provided an average incentive of 24% across the\\noffice portfolio leases signed in FY 2023. A couple of key office leasing transactions to highlight\\nover the year include 8,000 square meters, which were leased to multiple government\\ndepartments at our 100 Skyring Terrace, an excellent leasing outcome, de-risking the space\\nwhich had unfortunately become vacant after the previous tenant, Collection House, entered\\ninto voluntary administration at the end of FY 2022. Pleasingly one of our major tenants at 75',\n",
       " '\\nDorcas Street, South Melbourne, Mondelez Australia extended their 4,500 square meter lease\\nto 2028.',\n",
       " '\\nWe were also active across our industrial portfolio, leasing 124,000 square meters, representing\\n15.4% of the industrial portfolio income where we saw a positive average effective rental leasing\\nspread of 30%. We continue to see buoyant demand for industrial space, which remains in short\\nsupply. With leasing originating from a variety of industries, including pharmaceutical supply, the\\nautomotive industry, clothing retailers, and third-party logistics providers. Industrial incentives\\ngranted remained low at (00:14:12).',\n",
       " \"\\nThe defensive characteristics of the group's portfolio illustrated on slide 17. The portfolio WALE\\nreduced slightly over the year from 6.3 years to 6 years. However, we retained one of the\\nlongest office portfolio WALE in the REIT sector at 6.3 years. The portfolio was 93% occupied\\nwith 2% of additional leasing in advanced negotiation. Growthpoint continues to focus heavily on\\nmanaging leasing risk, and we are confident in our ability to negotiate the current challenges\\nwithin the office leasing market. We have a modern, highly green credentialed office portfolio,\\nand we have a strong track record of leasing on average 11.8% of the Growthpoint portfolio\\nannually over the last five years.\",\n",
       " '\\nSwitching now to sustainability on slide 18. Our portfolio continues to achieve a high average',\n",
       " \"\\nNABERS Energy rating of 5.2 stars, and we increased our GRESB score to 81, and remain a\\nsector leader in our space. Progress has been made with respect to the group's 2025 net zero\\ntarget through the execution of new electricity contracts, which include green power purchases.\",\n",
       " \"\\nGreen power will substantially contribute to achieving Growthpoint's 2025 target. We've\\nsignificantly increased our onsite solar rollout with seven additional installations progressed over\\nthe year. We also issued our first sustainability linked loans, which Dion will touch on.\",\n",
       " \"\\nI'll now hand over to Dion for the financial overview.\",\n",
       " '\\nThanks, Michael. Starting on slide 20, we again highlight our solid performance delivering FFO\\nof AUD 0.268 per security, a slight decrease of 3.2% on last year. Whilst down, this was a good\\noutcome given the rapid increase in interest rates and subsequent impact on interest costs.',\n",
       " '\\nHowever, NPI was up mainly due to two one-offs occurring during the year, which included a\\nsurrender of lease payment received in October 2022 for 5 Murray Rose Avenue in Sydney',\n",
       " '\\nOlympic Park. The lease was originally due to expire on April 2024 and the surrender payment\\nenabled Growthpoint to receive the net present value of the remaining leasing cut, meaning 22\\nmonths of income within the FY 2023 result. AUD 6.5 million bank guarantee payment received\\nwhen Collection House entered voluntary administration in June 2022, as we received a lease\\ntermination for its 8,000 square meters at our 100 Skyring Terrace, Newstead. The quality office\\nspace was progressively leased in FY 2023 by two high quality government tenants and the\\nproperty is now 100% occupied.',\n",
       " '\\nAt least two (00:16:58) properties had leased for all of FY 2023 as per their original lease terms,\\nthen FFO would have been around AUD 0.016 per security lower. Increased operating\\nexpenses, including the cost of operating the Fortius business, and generating a general cost\\ninflation. We were very pleased to declare a distribution of AUD 0.214 per security, up 2.9%.',\n",
       " \"\\nOn slide 21, we've highlighted the key movements in FFO and NTA per security. The key\\ndrivers of the FFO decrease include a substantial increase in interest costs up AUD 30 million or\\nalmost AUD 0.04 per security, which was partially offset by increased rental income and income\\ncontribution from Fortius. NTA per security decreased to AUD 4, down 12.3%, which is\\nconsistent with lower portfolio valuations, which in turn were driven by a significant increase of\\nthe risk-free rate during FY 2023.\",\n",
       " \"\\nTurning to slide 22, gearing increased from 31.6% at 30 June, 2022 to 37.2%, remaining within\\nthe group's target range of 35% to 45%. The increase relates to changes in portfolio valuations,\\ncompletion of the share buyback, purchase of Fortius, and of the GSO in Dandenong. These\\nwere partially offset by the sale of 333 Ann Street.\",\n",
       " '\\nWe retain a good buffer in our target gearing range to withstand any further potential changes in\\nvaluations. We also have ample headroom to our bank covenants of LCR of 60% and ICR\\ngreater than 1.6 times. Our distribution payout ratio was in the middle of the target payout ratio\\nrange of between 75% and 85% of FFO.',\n",
       " \"\\nOn slide 23, we take a look at our capital position moving into FY 2024. As you can see, we're\\nin good shape. Our weighted average cost of debt as of 30 June, 2023 was 4.6% versus 3.4%\\nsame time last year and reflects the rapid increase in interest rates during the year. The group\\nentered into eight new interest rate swaps for the total notional amount of AUD 280 million at a\\nweighted average fixed rate of 3.48%. As of 30 June, our debt facilities had a weighted average\\nremaining term to maturity of 3.4 years, and we retained AUD 300 million of undrawn bank debt\\nfacilities. We have no debt maturing until FY 2025.\",\n",

The program was completed in May 2023, having purchased 19.3 million\\nsecurities for a total consideration of AUD 63.4 million. Total purchases represented an average\\ndiscount for June 30, 2023 NTA of 17.9%. I'm also happy to convey that Moody's have\\nreaffirmed their BAA2 rating with a stable outlook for our debt.

       " '\\nREITs with significant office sector exposure. The discount to NTA at 30th of June, 2023 implies\\na 25% reduction (00:22:03) for both the office and industrial GOZ portfolios. We believe that the\\ndefensive characteristics of the office portfolio being long WALE and high quality tenants, and a\\nstrong industrial market with a historic low vacancy rate will be attractive to investors in a low\\ngrowth environment.',\n",

Growthpoint is well placed\\nto manage through the cycle with a portfolio of high quality modern assets with strong WALE\\nfrom government, ASX listed, and large corporate tenants.',\n",
       " '\\nTurning to financial year 2024 guidance. Given the outlook and factoring in interest costs on\\n(00:23:33) forward, we provide FFO guidance of between AUD 0.225 and AUD 0.231 per\\nsecurity for financial year 2024. We also provide distribution guidance of $0.193 per security\\nwhilst maintaining our FFO payout ratio in the target range of 75% to 85% at the midpoint of\\nguidance. At current pricing, the financial year 2024 distribution yield is an attractive 7.3%.

       " '\\nGood morning, Tim and team. Thank you for the presentation and congratulations, Tim, on your\\ntenure at Growthpoint. My first question was just around the guidance, I know you mentioned\\nthe $0.16 per share impact from the one-off in FY 2023. But if you reverse that at getting to an',\n",
       " '\\nFY 2023 underlying FFO of $0.252 per share, conscious cost of debt is going to be a headwind.',\n",

       " \"\\nThanks, Caleb. It's Dion here, I'll start on that one. So when we compare 2023 to 2024, there\\nare two key drivers. And you're right, debt is obviously one of them. And that's a factor across\\nthe REIT sector, I think. Our cost of debt at 4.6% at 30 June, we're going to average similar to\\nthat across the year, and that's obviously higher than it was in 2023. So that's one factor, but\\nthat's pretty common, and relatively easy to work out. The key factor, of course, is the one-offs,\\nas you pointed out. Another way to think about those one-offs though, if you take 5 Murray Rose\\nalone, there's 22 months' worth of rent in FY 2023, and the building is currently vacant going\\ninto 2024. We do assume leasing up across the year, but there are some weaker office leasing\\nmarkets in the month, so we're taking those into account. That is a very big driver of the\\ncomparison of FFO.\",\n",
       " '\\nAnd the other one you touched on is office vacancy. So again, we had a tenant (00:26:46) at 15',\n",
       " \"\\nGreen Square Close up in Queensland and they left in May. So again we had income for 11\\nmonths in FY 2023, and the building is currently Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that area, sorry, is currently vacant as we\\nhead into FY 2024 and again we'll need to lease up. So there is some occupancy as well. They\\nare the main drivers. Everything else is really pretty fringe operational expenses, and share\\nbuyback impact, all of those, I think are relatively minor in comparison to those two driving\\nfactors.\",\n",
       " '\\nThank you. And just so I understand, the AUD 0.252 should be outside of the one-off. So is cost\\nof debt really the difference between potentially going from AUD 0.252 to AUD 0.225.',\n",
       " \"\\nYeah. That AUD 0.016 what we said there is, if the leases continued as they were, right. Or the\\nrent just continued as it was that would have been a AUD 0.016 difference. That's not what\\nactually happened. We got 22 months worth of rent in the case of 5 Murray Rose. So don't get\\ntoo high up on the AUD 0.016, that was just meant to be a like-for-like sort of figure. The impact\\nis bigger when you take into account what actually happened, then the cost of debt is the rest.\",\n",
       " \"\\nOkay. And sorry, just to confirm in terms of what actually happened, I guess you're referring to\\noccupancy (00:28:13) opposed to what would it have been otherwise in FY 2023?\",\n",
       " \"\\nYeah. I think in respect of that particular transaction, it's Tim here, is you received 22 months of\\nincome in one year, and in the following year you have no income until you lease the property.\",\n",
       " \"\\nSo there's a big swing. I think Dion is trying to point that out.\",\n",
       " '\\nYes, yes.',\n",

       " '\\nMichael just around the office portfolio and some leasing outcomes. So conscious, there were\\nthose tenant exits throughout the year. But it seems to have ticked down again from 92% in',\n",
       " '\\nMarch to 90% as at June. Just beginning to understand what the incremental drivers were in the\\nmost recent quarter like the 2% under discussion. But any thoughts on how tenants are viewing\\nthe office portfolio at the moment?',\n",
       " '\\nYeah. Sure, Caleb. Thanks for the question. Really the difference between March and June\\ncomes to that QUU expiry (00:29:31) and vacation that Dion mentioned.',\n",
       " \"\\nSo at 7,500 square meters, in Fortitude Valley, where they're located, and moved up, and we're\\njust progressively leasing that up. But that's really the difference between the two. And the start\\nof the leasing portfolio, I mean, we did more leasing in the second half than we did in the first\\nhalf across our office portfolio. So that was pleasing to see sort of 10,000 square meters in the\\nfirst half versus 19,000 in the second half. As I mentioned on the call, we had some really strong\\nresults, and good tenant inquiry from the government, so backfilling 8,000 square meters in\",\n",
       " \"\\nSkyring Terrace was a terrific effort, particularly given that that had unexpectedly become\\nvacant. And I think it just shows the high quality of the assets that we own when you can have\\nlimited downtime for that property space. Clearly we're trying to execute a similar strategy with 5\",\n",
       " \"\\nMurray Rose, and that property as I mentioned is getting some good attention, but we need to\\nexecute on that. So that's the real focus (00:30:31).\",\n",
       " \"\\nRight. And maybe just if you had any sort of broader thoughts or statements then in terms of\\nhow you're thinking about health of tenants across the portfolio, that the WALE is clearly quite\\nhelpful until potentially some tenants go into administration, et cetera, as we saw in FY 2023.\\n(00:30:56) government should be fine but just in terms of the other corporate across\\ngovernment portfolio?\",\n",
       " \"\\nYeah. We have a very strong portfolio of tenant covenants really that there was a bit of an\\nexception where we had a tenant go into administration. We monitor our lease on a weekly\\nbasis on the de minimis side, we're not seeing any signs across the portfolio of any distressed\\ntenants. We've got 95% of the income being derived from non-SME tenants, and like we saw\\nduring COVID period, we really have very limited, rent related questions (00:31:36). So, our\\nportfolio was in very good shape (00:31:40).\",\n",
       " \"\\nOkay. Great. Thank you very much. That's really helpful. And congratulations again, Tim.\",\n",
       " '\\nThank you, Caleb.',\n",
       " '\\nThank you. Your next question comes from Solomon Zhang at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.',\n",
       " \"\\nGood morning, Tim and team. First question for me is just on gearing. So I understand you're\\nwell within covenant limits, but 37% is I guess, a bit high versus peers. And in the context of a\\ndevaluation cycle, just curious, how comfortable are you with current gearing and have you\\nbeen considering chopping assets or punching out (00:32:16)?\",\n",
       " \"\\nThanks Solomon, Dion here again. Look, currently your question first off, we're very comfortable\\nwhere the gearing currently sits. We've got a range of 35% to 45% we're at the bottom of that\\nrange. We're below the bottom of the range at the start (00:32:32), which has now been going\\nfor a year. And as you mentioned, we've got plenty of headroom to our covenants. So we're\\nvery, very comfortable and we wouldn't be selling assets just to reduce gearing.\\n(00:32:43) no assets on the market or in the process.\",\n",
       " \"\\nWe do have two small industrial assets on the market right now, but that's really just normal\\nportfolio maintenance.\",\n",
       " '\\nYep. Got you. Next question is just on the office portfolio, is it a fair comment? I mean, lots of\\nyour office portfolio, I guess, is characterized by large (00:33:00). Is this proving to be a bit more\\nchallenging to lease up given smaller (00:33:08) are more active in leasing markets right now?',\n",
       " \"\\nThat's not what we're really saying. We've done a number of (00:33:15) tenants over the last 12\\nmonths. We've also done a number of multi-floor tenanted spaces. We've never been adverse\\nto chopping close up where we see it's necessary and we're going to drive better leasing\\noutcomes. But due to the nature of the asset, the A-grade, high quality, high green credential\\ncomponents of those assets they still tend to attract the larger requirements.\",\n",
       " '\\nYeah. Got you. Maybe another one for you Michael. Just on the re-leasing spreads in industrial,\\nwhat are you seeing in your recent leasing and where would you mark to market your rents?',\n",
       " \"\\nYeah. So I've mentioned on the call that we saw an effective basis sort of circa 30% uplift on the\\neffective rents across the industrial portfolio. On the mark-to-market against the value is rents at\\n30 June, I think about 8% under, but that's really (00:34:09) on where the rents sit, and\\nobviously the market's been moving quite quickly into June.\",\n",
       " '\\nYeah.',\n",
       " \"\\nSo, it's a bit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on a valuation basis (00:34:20).\",\n",
       " '\\nThank you. Appreciate it.',\n",
       " '\\nThank you. Your next question comes from Ben Bradshaw at Barrenjoey. Please go ahead.',\n",
       " '\\nTim, congratulations on a very successful tenure as CEO, and all the best for the future.',\n",
       " '\\nThank you.',\n",
       " '\\nFirst question, just on logistics, I was wondering if you could just describe liquidity at the\\nmoment in the current environment as to how it relates to the markets in which you operate for\\nthe type of assets in which you own. What sort of buyer demand are you seeing, and is there a\\nbid/ask spread?',\n",
       " \"\\nSo, a good question, Ben. So we obviously work across all the three principal markets and\\nthrough the funds management business in the retail sector. So all of those (00:35:20) sectors,\\nand this is my observation, that the retail property market is quite liquid with a large format retail,\\nwe're seeing neighborhood shopping centers, and a bit more recently we're seeing (00:35:38) in\\nregional shopping centers. So they are trading. Industrial, I think a lot of rentals have held off to\\ncapture the rental growth coming through. So they're probably a bit more reluctant, but we\\nobviously have the AUD 560 million sale of the Korean pension fund to AustralianSuper and\\n(00:36:08) managed portfolio. So that's a significant transaction in the market, and shows that\\nthere are large institutional investors for large logistics portfolios.\",\n",
       " '\\nAnd then probably on the smaller side of logistics assets are still trading, still being marketed.',\n",
       " \"\\nSo it's not as liquid as it was a couple of years ago, but nevertheless, fairly liquid. I think the\\noffice sector, as you've probably witnessed, there's probably a larger bid/ask spread, and the\\nvolume of assets has come back significantly. And so I would say the liquidity in the office\\nsector is probably less strong.\",\n",
       " '\\nTerrific, Tim. Thanks once again. And congratulations on your time at Growthpoint.',\n",
       " '\\nThank you.',\n",
       " '\\nThank you. Your next question comes from Howard Penney at Citi. Please go ahead.',\n",
       " \"\\nThanks, guys, for the presentation. Just one or two additional questions. The first one on the\\nfunds management business. What's the outlook to grow the assets under management there\\nand attracting additional funds there?\",\n",
       " \"\\nThink you, Howard. It's Tim here. We're confident about it. Obviously, there is less as we just\\ncommented. There has been less liquidity in the market. We certainly are looking across sectors\\nfor investment opportunities for the investors that we cater for. So our experience, if you find a\\ngood deal, the investors will be there. So the high net worth investors and also key cornerstone\\ninvestors are also keen to invest again for the right opportunities. I think it's important to note\\nthat Australia on a global context is still seen as very attractive. We have a growing population.\",\n",
       " \"\\nWe have a relatively strong economy, and it's well regulated. And any correction in the market\\nfor any type of asset is really being seen as an opportunity in the cycle for offshore investors. So\\nover the medium term, we are confident about the prospects for the funds management\\nbusiness.\",\n",
       " '\\nGreat. Thank you very much. And I see in the slide pack you mentioned on the vacant space at\\n5 Murray Rose and also some advanced negotiations of 2% of the total space. Do you have any\\nadditional info on that or timing that you could share?',\n",
       " \"\\nHoward, it's Michael here. We can't right now, they're sort of progressing at various stages. And\",\n",
       " \"\\nI expect that there'll be a further update obviously at our quarterly announcement, but until then,\\nwe can't really disclose anything further.\",\n",
       " '\\nUnderstood. And just a final question from me. You mentioned that bid/ask spread on office\\ntransactions is still wide. But given where cap rates have shifted in this results season on the\\noffice side, how far do you think those expectations are from these levels?',\n",
       " \"\\nI think I think you'll see more liquidity into the market in this next half, clearly the cap rates have\\nmoved up in line with some of the transactions that have happened. So I would anticipate the\\nbid/ask spread will be narrower this time around.\",\n",
       " '\\nGreat. Thanks a lot. And well done, Tim. Thank you for the service.',\n",
       " '\\nThank you, Howard.',\n",
       " '\\nThank you. Your next question comes from Edward Day at Moelis Australia. Please go ahead.',\n",
       " '\\nGood morning, Tim and team. And Tim congratulations on your tenure at Growthpoint. Just a\\ncouple for me. Just trying to understand your guidance range. Clearly, (00:40:30) 5 Murray',\n",
       " '\\nRose is a bit of a swing factor, but wondering what your assumptions are around the\\ncontribution from the Fortius business?',\n",
       " \"\\nYeah. Thanks. I'll take that one. Look, the contribution from the funds management arm is still\\nrelatively minor as it is, we need to grow the funds so it start to increase its contribution to our\\nresults. So not a big swing factor. Clearly, interest rates, we do have an average that we put into\\nour assumptions. But, if you go back two months, that number would have been quite a bit\\ndifferent to what it is today. So although it looks a lot more stable today, it is still quite volatile.\",\n",
       " \"\\nSo I think you'll see guidance ranges reasonably wide on that basis alone.\",\n",
       " \"\\nThanks, Dion. And just one more on the funds management business just in terms of\\nrelationships with your capital partners, there's obviously been a press around redemption\\npressure. Are you seeing any of that coming through that the funds management business?\",\n",
       " \"\\nThanks, Ed. Well, the funds management business obviously has been impacted by higher\\ninterest rates, which is across the industry and we have fixed term funds as well. So we're in the\\nprocess of paying particular attention to each fund and what the appropriate strategies might be\\nto renegotiate covenants and might be to sell the property at their term and realize the funds,\\nand then attractive IRR for investors or might be extending the term of the fund for the benefit of\\nthe investors. So there's a range of strategies, but no doubt the market circumstances of a\\n(00:42:30) fund is, that which is being experienced by the other fund managers as well.\",\n",
       " '\\nGreat. Thank you.',\n",
       " '\\nThank you. Your next question comes from Alex Prineas at Morningstar. Please go ahead.',\n",
       " '\\nThank you, and thanks for the presentation. Are you able to say what interest cover ratio is\\nimplied by your FY 2024 guidance?',\n",
       " \"\\nWe're not providing forecast ICRs. Not really in the business of doing that. I think the important\\nthing is, when you look at the flexibility or the amount of headroom that we do give in our\\npresentation to ICR, (00:43:22) over 50% before we reach that covenant, which I think is highly\\nunlikely. So we're not concerned about covenants. We do have a lower covenants and most of\\nthem at (00:43:33) 1.6 times, and yeah we're over 3 times as we enter the year, but no, we\\nwon't provide a forecast.\",\n",
       " \"\\nOkay. No problem. And just a second one on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so there's a decent well, pretty low expiries\\nthe next couple of years, but FY 2026 it looks like there's a bit of a step up in lease expiries.\",\n",
       " '\\nJust wondering, it maybe too early, but can you comment at all on how entrenched those\\ntenants may be or are they more likely to be in the market for space at that time?',\n",
       " \"\\nYeah. So two of the key tenants we're looking at there are Woolworths and Linfox. And Linfox,\\nfor example, occupy three of our logistics properties at Erskine Park, which is probably the\\nhottest logistics market in the country right now. And suffice to say that, that valuation base is\\nconsidered to be (00:44:32) on the market rent right now. So I would anticipate that if the market\\nconditions prevail in the logistics sector, they'll be very sticky to that location. And if they're not,\\nthen we'll have sound reasoning to think that we'll find other tenants in a quick action.\",\n",
       " \"\\nAnd Woolworths is the other large logistics provider in our experience, given that we've had\",\n",

    "* `Entity-extraction` (extracción de entidades). Se refiere a la identificación y clasificación de entidades mencionadas en el texto, como nombres de personas, lugares , organizaciones, etc.\n",
    "* `Relation-extraction` (extracción de relaciones). Implica identificar y clasificar las relaciones semánticas entre entidades previamente extraidas. Por ejemplo, en una oración como \"Bill gates es fundador de Microsoft\", identificariamos la relación \"fundador\" entre las entidades \"Bill Gates\" y \"Microsoft\". Otras posibles relaciones que se pueden extraer indirectamente son: \"Bill Gates es emprendedor\", \"Bill Gates es empresario\", etc.\n",

However, it was still above initial guidance provided at the financial year 2022 results, which shows the company's ability to manage and mitigate the impact of external factors.\\n4. Decline in property portfolio value | -7 | The group's property portfolio value decreased by 6.5% on a like-for-like basis over 12 months due to higher interest rates and consequential impact on capitalization and discount rates. This was a primary driver of the lower NTA.\\n5. Strong leasing activity in metro and fringe CBD office markets | 8 | According to JLL data, the metro and fringe CBD office markets have grown more strongly than CBDs, reflecting tenant demand. Growthpoint's portfolio is well-positioned in these markets, with high-quality assets and close proximity to key transport modes.\\n6.

Growthpoint's leasing performance was strong, with over 156,000 square meters leased equivalent to 11.2% of income, resulting in occupancy of 93% across the portfolio. | Score: 8 | This is a positive development as it shows a high occupancy rate and strong leasing performance, which will lead to sustainable income returns for securityholders.\\n\\n2. The group's goal remains to provide securityholders with sustainable income returns and capital appreciation over the long-term. | Score: 9 | This is a very positive development as it shows the company's commitment to its investors and its long-term strategy for growth and value creation.\\n\\n3. In financial year 2023, Growthpoint purchased the GSO building in Dandenong with a 9.4-year WALE and divested 333 Ann Street, Brisbane with a 3.7-year WALE. | Score: 7 | This is a positive development as it shows the company's focus on acquiring high-quality assets and divesting underperforming ones, which will maximize value for securityholders.\\n\\n4. Capital management remains a sharp focus given the high interest rate environment. | Score: 8 | This is a positive development as it shows the company's proactive approach to managing its capital in a challenging market environment.\\n\\n5. The group's property portfolio value decreased by 6.5% on a like-for-like basis over 12 months due to higher interest rates and consequential impact on capitalization and discount rates. | Score: -6 | This is a negative development as it shows a decline in the company's property portfolio value, which will have a negative impact on its net tangible assets (NTA).\\n\\n6. Despite challenging market conditions, distributions declared for the period were up 2.9%. | Score: 7 | This is a positive development as it shows the company's ability to maintain and even increase distributions to its investors despite challenging market conditions.\\n\\n7. The positive momentum in the industrial markets continued in financial year 2023 due to a shortage of modern warehouse space across all markets, underpinned by growth in e-commerce and demand for supply chain infrastructure. | Score: 9 | This is a very positive development as it shows a strong demand for the company's industrial properties, which will lead to higher rental growth and occupancy rates.\\n\\n8. The acquisition of Fortius Funds Management, a property fund manager with a 30-year plus track record of delivering strong returns to its investors, was completed in September 2022. | Score: 9 | This is a very positive development as it shows the company's expansion into the funds management business, which will provide long-term growth opportunities and strong returns for investors.\\n\\n9. The group's office portfolio is reduced by 9.4% on a like-for-like basis over the year, while the industrial portfolio valuations only have witnessed a slight decline. | Score: -5 | This is a negative development as it shows a decline in the company's office portfolio value, which will have a negative impact on its NTA.\\n\\n10. Tenant engagement is a major focus for Growthpoint, and this has been reflected by achieving industry leading tenant satisfaction results in the independent annual tenant survey. | Score: 10 | This is a very positive development as it shows the company's commitment to tenant satisfaction, which will lead to higher retention rates and a positive reputation in the market.\\n\\n11. The company's high quality, energy efficient buildings are attractive for government tenants, and the WALE of its government office tenants is 10.3 years. | Score: 9 | This is a very positive development as it shows the company's strong tenant base and long-term lease agreements with government tenants, which will provide stability and consistent income for securityholders.\\n\\n12. Growthpoint achieved a 92% satisfaction rating in the independent annual tenant survey, which is a testament to its team's focus on tenant engagement. | Score: 10 | This is a very positive development as it shows the company's strong relationship with its tenants and its commitment to providing a positive tenant experience.\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\nLeasing activity in office portfolio shows positive results | 8 | The group executed 33 leases, accounting for approximately 32,000 square meters of space, representing 9.2% of the office portfolio income. The group provided an average incentive of 24% across the office portfolio leases signed in FY 2023, indicating strong demand for office space.\\n\\nIndustrial portfolio leasing shows positive growth | 9 | The group leased 124,000 square meters, representing 15.4% of the industrial portfolio income, with a positive average effective rental leasing spread of 30%. This demonstrates strong demand for industrial space and a diverse range of industries leasing from the portfolio.\\n\\nPortfolio WALE remains strong | 10 | The portfolio WALE reduced slightly over the year from 6.3 years to 6 years, but still retains one of the longest office portfolio WALE in the REIT sector at 6.3 years. This indicates a stable and secure income stream for the group.\\n\\nHigh average NABERS Energy rating and increased GRESB score | 9 | The portfolio continues to achieve a high average NABERS Energy rating of 5.2 stars and increased its GRESB score to 81, remaining a sector leader. This demonstrates the group's commitment to sustainability and its progress towards its 2025 net zero target.\\n\\nSolid financial performance with FFO of AUD 0.268 per security | 7 | Despite a slight decrease of 3.2% from last year, this was a good outcome given the rapid increase in interest rates. The group also declared a distribution of AUD 0.214 per security, up 2.9%.\\n\\nGearing remains within target range | 8 | Gearing increased from 31.6% to 37.2%, but still remains within the group's target range of 35% to 45%. The group also has ample headroom to its bank covenants and a good buffer to withstand any further potential changes in valuations.\\n\\nWeighted average cost of debt increases due to interest rate rise | -6 | The weighted average cost of debt increased from 3.4% to 4.6% due to the rapid increase in interest rates during the year.\\n\\nSuccessful execution of new electricity contracts and sustainability linked loans | 9 | The group has made progress towards its 2025 net zero target through the execution of new electricity contracts, including green power purchases. It has also issued its first sustainability linked loans, demonstrating its commitment to sustainability.\\n\\nDiscount to NTA implies a 25% reduction for both office and industrial portfolios | -8 | The current security price discount to NTA implies a 25% reduction for both the office and industrial portfolios. This is a common theme across the REIT sector, but the defensive characteristics of the group's portfolio make it an attractive investment in a low growth environment.\\n\\nPortfolio of high quality modern assets with strong WALE and diverse tenant base | 9 | The group's portfolio consists of high quality modern assets with strong WALE from government, ASX listed, and large corporate tenants. This provides stability and security for the group's income stream.\\n\\nLow commercial real estate transaction activity | -7 | Commercial real estate transaction activity remains low, but the group is well positioned to manage through the cycle with its strong portfolio and prudent management of its balance sheet.\",\n",
